# CodeClauseInternship_PersonalityPrediction
Golden-level CodeClause AI Internship project – Predicts personality from resume using NLP and GUI with Tkinter.
# Personality Prediction System via CV (GUI)

This is a golden-level AI project developed as part of the CodeClause Artificial Intelligence Internship. The system predicts personality traits (Introvert or Extrovert) from the textual content of resumes using NLP and machine learning.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The application analyzes `.docx` resume files and predicts personality using logistic regression trained on sample behavioral descriptions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter
- NLP (TF-IDF)
- Scikit-learn
- docx (python-docx)

## 📁 Files Included
- `personality_gui.py`: GUI script that allows uploading a resume and predicts personality
- `Project_Report.txt`: Project documentation detailing scope and implementation

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn python-docx
```

2. **Run the GUI**
```bash
python personality_gui.py
```

3. **Upload Resume**
- Click 'Browse' in the GUI and upload a `.docx` file
- The personality result will be displayed in a popup

## ✨ Key Features
- Simple GUI using Tkinter
- Reads `.docx` resumes
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression for prediction

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on GUI building
- Practical use of NLP and ML for personality modeling
- File handling and string processing from documents
